            <h2>Pip producers is a blog site for currency and day traders.</h2>

            <p>Pip producers is built on the MERN stack architecture. 
                <em>MongoDB, Express, React, Node js</em></p>
        </div>
        

        <div class='container sec'>
            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <p>If you are not running the application locally you can skip to "Inside the Application"</p>
            
            <br />
            <h3>Setup prerequisits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Internet connection</li>
                <li>Node js and NPM installed</li>
                <li>Terminal access</li>
                <li>Basic knowledge of each item</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <p><strong>1)</strong> The project can be cloned directly from the git repository or downloaded.</p>

            <p><strong>2)</strong> Run the following scripts from the root directory to install dependencies:</p>
            <pre>
        $ npm install
        $ npm run client-install
        <br />
        <em>***the scripts above will work with yarn</em>
            </pre>
            

            <p><strong>3)</strong> To connect to a database the URI should be placed within a file called default.json 
            and placed inside theconfig folder of the root directory. The project will work with any 
            Mongo shell i.e. RoboMongo or mLab</p>

            <p>Click <a href='https://robomongo.org/download' target='blank'>here for RoboMongo</a></p>
            <p>Click <a href='https://mlab.com/' target='blank'>here for mLab</a></p>

            <p>Input the information that corresponds to your database. The database can be named anything 
            as long as the DB URI contains the correct title</p>
            <p><em>Inside of default.json</em></p>
            <pre>
        {
            'mongoURI": "mongodb://<<em>username</em>>:<<em>dbpassword</em>>@<<em>dsreference</em>>.mlab.com:XXXXX/<em>pip_producer</em>",
            "JWT_SECRET": "<<em>secret random string here</em>>"
        }
            </pre>

            <p><strong>4)</strong> Use the following scripts to run the application:</p>
            <pre>
        <em>Run server on port 5000, and client on port 3000</em>
        $ npm run dev
        <br />
        <em>Only start server on port 5000</em>
        $ npm start
        <br />
        <em>Only start server with watch on port 5000</em>
        $ npm run server
        <br />
        <em>Only run client (port 3000) without server</em>
        $ npm run client
        <br />
        <em>***the scripts above will work with yarn</em>
            </pre>
        </div>
        

        <div class='container'>
            <h2>Inside the Application</h2>
            <p>The site can be found 
            <a href='https://fierce-springs-23091.herokuapp.com/' target='blank'>here.</a></p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Pip producers uses a roles based authorization method. A user's role is held by
            their web token. Their are 3 roles: user, contributor and admin. A users role determines
            what CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) operations they are allowed to perform. New users 
            will automatically be assigned the role of user upon signing up for the site.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Users: can read <em>published</em> blogs</li>
                <li>Contributors: can read published blogs and publish blogs. They can also save drafts   
                and read all drafts. Contributors are able to edit and delete published blogs and drafts they 
                create.</li>
                <li>Admins: can read and write published/drafts. They can also edit or delete any published 
                or save draft on the site. Admins can access the <em>users</em> page and elevate users to
                contributors or admins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Once an admin is created it cannot be revoked at this time</em></p>

            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>This site is fully responsive and should work on any number of different screens. The main 
            breakpoints are 768px and 1300px. Note: this site does not contain a window.onResize handler 
            so pages must be refreshed for layout settings to take place after a resize event.</p>

            <h3>Creating Blogs</h3>
            <p>To create a blog use the 'Create' button on the navbar. The data model for a blog contains 
            X elements.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>Author</li>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Cover image*</li>
                <li>Blog content</li>
                <li>Publish option**</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>*Currently the blog supports one file upload per blog.</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click "Choose A Cover Image".</li>
                <li>Select an image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg) files.</li>
                <li>Click the upload button. A thumbnail of the image should appear below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>**Publish option is set to draft by default. If you wish the publish the blog simply select 
            'publish' on the 'publish/draft' button assemby.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Updating Blogs</h3>
            <p>A contributor can update any blog, published or draft, they themselves created. Admins can 
            update any blog on the site. Clicking the 'edit' button on the edit bar will bring the user 
            to a page that looks like the <em>create</em> page. The difference is the information will be 
            filled into the inputs. The date is the only input that doesn't auto fill and must be re-entered</p>

            <h3>Deleting Blogs</h3>
            <p>Clicking the 'delete' button on the edit bar will immediately delete the blog from the 
            database. There currently isn't a confirmation for this process. The blog may not appear to be deleted, 
            to update the UI the site currently requires a refresh.</p>

            <p>Contributors can delete any blog or draft they create. Admins can delete any blog or draft.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong><em> The developers at Pip Producers kindly ask users not delete blogs they 
            didn't create. This will help keep the site stocked with dummy blogs for future users.</em></p>

            <h3>Dummy Users</h3>
            <p>A user can create their own user account which will instantiate a new account with <em>user</em>
            privileges</p>
            
            <p>There are 9 dummy accounts. 4 users, 3 contributors, and 2 admins.</p>

            <h3>Navbars and Expected Behavior</h3>
            <p>Site accessibility and authorization is defined in the navbar. That is, nav links appear 
            differently depending on user authorization level. The 'blog' button appears on the left, but 
            all other buttons appear on the right.</p>

            <br /><br />
            <img src='./assets/navbar.png' alt='navbar' />
            <br /><br />

            <p>Buttons will only render if they are relevant to the current role.</p>

            <p>Losing access during a session by refreshing the page or by entering an incorrect URL is 
            unexpected behavior and could be the result of a bug.</p>

            <p>Currently this site does not have an alert system. Alerts are pending for future updates.</p>
