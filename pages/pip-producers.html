            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Pip producers uses a roles based authorization method. A user's role is held by
            their web token. Their are 3 roles: user, contributor and admin. A users role determines
            what CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) operations they are allowed to perform. New users 
            will automatically be assigned the role of user upon signing up for the site.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Users: can read <em>published</em> blogs</li>
                <li>Contributors: can read published blogs and publish blogs. They can also save drafts   
                and read all drafts. Contributors are able to edit and delete published blogs and drafts they 
                create.</li>
                <li>Admins: can read and write published/drafts. They can also edit or delete any published 
                or save draft on the site. Admins can access the <em>users</em> page and elevate users to
                contributors or admins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Once an admin is created it cannot be revoked at this time</em></p>

            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>This site is fully responsive and should work on any number of different screens. The main 
            breakpoints are 768px and 1300px. Note: this site does not contain a window.onResize handler 
            so pages must be refreshed for layout settings to take place after a resize event.</p>

            <h3>Creating Blogs</h3>
            <p>To create a blog use the 'Create' button on the navbar. The data model for a blog contains 
            6 elements.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>Author</li>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Cover image*</li>
                <li>Blog content</li>
                <li>Publish option**</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>*Currently the blog supports one file upload per blog.</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click "Choose A Cover Image".</li>
                <li>Select an image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg) files.</li>
                <li>Click the upload button. A thumbnail of the image should appear below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>**Publish option is set to draft by default. If you wish the publish the blog simply select 
            'publish' on the 'publish/draft' button assemby.</em></p>

            <h3>Reading Blogs</h3>
            <p>To find the list page click 'blog' on the left side of the nav bar. If you are logged in as 
            a user you will see a page titled articles which will list out the blogs. The most current 4-5 Blogs
            also appear at the bottom of any blog. If you are logged in as a contributor or an admin you will 
            have the option on the list page to switch between published and drafts. Contributors will be able
            to read drafts from other contributors, but they will not be able to edit them.</p>
            
            <h3>Updating Blogs</h3>
            <p>A contributor can update any blog, published or draft, they themselves created. Admins can 
            update any blog on the site. Clicking the 'edit' button on the edit bar will bring the user 
            to a page that looks like the <em>create</em> page. The difference is the information will be auto 
            filled into the inputs. The date is the only input that doesn't auto fill and must be re-entered</p>

            <h3>Deleting Blogs</h3>
            <p>Clicking the 'delete' button on the edit bar will immediately delete the blog from the 
            database. There currently isn't a confirmation for this process. The blog may not appear to be deleted, 
            to update the UI the site currently requires a refresh.</p>

            <p>Contributors can delete any blog or draft they create. Admins can delete any blog or draft.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong><em> The developers at Pip Producers kindly ask users not to delete blogs they 
            didn't create. This will help keep the site stocked with dummy blogs for future users.</em></p>

            <h3>Updating Users</h3>
            <p>The site currently supports updating users to 'contributor' or 'admin' status. Only admins 
            are able to update users. Once an admin is created it cannot be undone. Currently the site does 
            not have a way to delete users.</p>

            <h3>Dummy Users</h3>
            <p>A user can create their own user account which will instantiate a new account with <em>user</em>
            privileges</p>
            
            <p>There are 9 dummy accounts. 4 users, 3 contributors, and 2 admins.</p>

            <h3>Navbars and Expected Behavior</h3>
            <p>Site accessibility and authorization is defined in the navbar. That is, nav links appear 
            differently depending on user authorization level. The 'blog' button appears on the left, but 
            all other buttons appear on the right.</p>

            <br /><br />
            <img src='../assets/img/pip-producers/navbar.png' alt='navbar' />
            <br /><br />

            <p>Buttons will only render if they are relevant to the current role.</p>

            <p>Losing access during a session by refreshing the page or by entering an incorrect URL is 
            unexpected behavior and could be the result of a bug.</p>

            <p>Currently this site does not have an alert system. Alerts are pending for future updates.</p>
            <br /><br /><br />
